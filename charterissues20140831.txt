1. Need for a problem statement is addressed in v7 but not all points covered:
- mention operational costs/staffing 
- show relevance to AN specifically 
- mention self-managing properties, closed loop control & device-to-device communication aspect 
- mention one or two example parameters/functions
- be clear about overall objective 

2. Charter currently jumps straight to goals - needs bridging logic 

3. Must be clear why initial focus is on specific reusable infrastructure
components and one or two elementary use cases/service agents (avoiding
contentious terms like "generic" and "unified")  

4 Mention scope question (local, admin domain, multi-domain) 

5. Specify address prefix use case & service agent as in scope. 

6. Other use cases/service agents could be in scope of discussion
but not in initial chartered deliverables 

7. Specify excluded topics that might be candidates for future work 
  - analytics
  - intent 
  - other external information sources
  - system-wide integration of autonomics 


8. Define milestones in English, not in pseudo-draft names 

9. Should relationship to NMRG be mentioned? Other use cases to NMRG? 

10. Mention security more
